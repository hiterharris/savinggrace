So many dogs and puppies have been given a second chance at wonderful, loving forever homes through the rescue. Being a county shelter, I have very limited resources. Saving Grace makes it possible for me to help change and save lives. I believe that what Molly is doing makes a huge impact and difference. I wanted to be a part of that so I joined her team, and now I'm part of the great mission. it just doesn't get any better than this…”
