      <h2>Adoption</h2>

      <h2>How to Avoid Common Problems and Create a Successful Transition for Your New Dogs</h2>

       <p>Your new dog was crate trained and socialized at Saving Grace. But that does not guarantee a seamless transition into your life, your house, and your routine. Your dog needs your time and effort to generalize his manners to your life. Set your dog up to succeed by planning ahead of time and sticking to your routine right off the bat.</p>
       <div class="box">
         <p class="list-header">With this in mind, you should assume that your new dog:</p>
         <ul>
          <li>Is not housetrained adn needs to be taught this in your home by you. </li>
  	      <li>Needs your help to feel at ease when confined, both when you are at home and when you are away.</li>
          <li>If not properly exercised, confined, supervised and given outlets for normal dog behavior your dog will act out in a variety of ways. Like chewing on your things, counter surf, get into the trash, bark out the window, or be a nuisance in the yard. It is your job to prevent these annoying behaviors so train your dog to behavior the way you want. </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="list-header">Daily essentials for a well-behaved dog:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide daily aerobic exercise.</li>
  	      <li>Teach “sit” and use it before feeding, putting the leash on, and leaving it in the house.</li>
          <li>Feed on schedule and take uneaten food away after 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Use the crate or a dog-proofed, baby-gated room everytime you need to take your eyes off your dog.</li>
          <li>Be generous in providing edible chew toys to keep your dogs mouth and brain busy. </li>

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <button class="accordion">Why is the adoption fee so much? Why do you charge an adoption fee rather than give the animals away for free?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The average medical expenses of an animal at Saving Grace costs approximately $400. We want to make sure we are adopting out healthy animals and provide all necessary vet care. Each animal is given a routine physical, spayed/neutered and all vaccines and deworming. They are also microchipped and tested for heartworms and treated if necessary.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Why does my pet need to be spayed/neutered? Can I adopt an intact animal?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Spaying and neutering helps stem the tide of overpopulation. It does not make animals fat and lazy, harm their health, or hurt their personalities, as some people mistakenly believe. Spaying not only reduces the stress and discomfort females endure during heat periods, but also eliminates the risk of uterine cancer and reduces the chance of mammary cancer. Neutering makes males far less likely to roam or fight, and helps prevent testicular cancer.</p>
        <p>All animals adopted through Saving Grace are already altered before adoption. There are millions of unwanted dogs, puppies, kittens and cats euthanized in shelters each year and Saving Grace is committed to reducing the population of unwanted animals.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Is there a trial period to take the pet home and see if it 'fits' with the family?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Saving Grace makes all efforts to make sure that a good match is made between adopters and dogs before adoption. Most of the dogs at Saving Grace have been in transit from being stray, to a shelter, to Saving Grace and are eager for a permanent home that will provide them with consistency. When they are returned, they have to once again acclimate to Saving Grace and then another home. Due to this, we do not offer a trial period.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Can I adopt a pet for someone else?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No. Only the person who will be caring for the pet is allowed to adopt. This is in the best interest of both the pet and the adopter. If you really want to make the adoption a "gift," we recommend a gift certificate. Selecting a pet is a very personal decision and the recipient will appreciate being able to make his or her own choice.</p>
      </div>

      <button class="accordion">Do I need any experience to be a volunteer?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>No. Saving Grace is always looking for volunteers with any level of experience as long as they love animals! We are willing to teach dog care and training to anyone willing to learn. There are also lots of volunteer opportunities that greatly benefit the dogs but don't involve contact with the dogs. Please see our home page for more information about volunteering.</p>

      <button class="accordion">How to make heads or tails out of flea preventatives:</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>Topical products (those that you place directly onto your pet's skin) revolutionized the treatment of fleas. These products work by inhibiting nerve transmissions in insects, causing paralysis and death of the flea. Some products contain additional ingredients called insect growth regulators that target other flea life stages to increase efficacy. The most common products are Frontline, Advantage, K9 Advantix and Revolution. Frontline and K9 Advantix are the only products that also kill ticks. K9 Advantix has additional tick repellant activity that is helpful if you plan on taking your dog into wooded areas with high tick burdens. Caution: this product is toxic to cats and should be used with caution if your cat and dog have contact with each other. Frontline Plus (not Frontline Top Spot) has an additional ingredient to kill the larval and egg stages of the flea in addition to killing the adults. Revolution is the only topical that also will protect dogs from heartworm disease in addition to some intestinal de-worming action, although it has almost no activity against ticks. All the topical products work even if your pet swims, however bathing can severely decrease their efficacy. These products are all absorbed into the hair follicles and sebaceous glands of the skin, so if you bathe your pet with a soap based shampoo, it will strip the product away. Your veterinarian can advise you on a safe shampoo to use with a topical product.</p><p>There are also several oral flea preventatives on the market. One benefit of these products is that they avoid the messiness associated with the topicals. The other benefit is that some of these products produce a very fast kill of adult fleas. The downside to these products is that they have no activity against ticks. These products include Program, Sentinel, Capstar and Comfortis. Program was the first oral preventative on the market and can be purchased over the counter. It works by inhibiting the development of flea eggs. It does not have any activity against adult fleas, which is problematic for dogs with flea allergies. The active drug in Program (lufenuron) is now found in Sentinel, a monthly heartworm and flea preventative. This drug is ideal for small breed dogs that do not have high exposure to ticks. Capstar was the first oral medication to have a very fast flea kill (within 30 minutes of ingestion). It is very safe and can be used in animals as young as 4 weeks. The downside is that it only works for 24 hours, making it cost prohibitive as a first line preventative, although it is a good adjunct product when trying to get a flea infestation under control. Comfortis is the newest drug on the market, debuting in 2007. It starts killing fleas within 30 minutes with all adult fleas dead within 4 hours. It lasts for one month and can be used either alone as a preventative or in conjunction with topical products if needed for severe infestations. It is very effective, but cannot be used in animals under 14 weeks of age.</p>

      <button class="accordion">I live out of town, does Saving Grace ship dogs?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>We send many lucky dogs home with happy adopters who have come to visit from out of state. But unlike puppy mills or many questionable breeders and rescue organizations, we never ship dogs. This protects you and it protects the dog.</p>
